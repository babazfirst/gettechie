# Create Application


## What is Project Scaffolding 

**[Scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming))**, as used in computing, refers to one of two techniques: 
  1. for code generation technique related to database access in some model–view–controller frameworks 
  2. for project generation technique supported by various tools. 

We will focus only on the second technique (**project scaffolding**) which generates a starting point for a project based on a number of required inputs. 

Spring team has provided multiple ways to quickly bootstrap a Spring Boot application. You can either use the [**Spring Initializr**](https://start.spring.io/) or [**Spring Boot CLI**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started.installing.cli) to scaffold a Spring Boot project.  

We will use [**Spring Initializr**](https://start.spring.io/) for this project. 

## Do

### 1. Create New Spring Boot Project  

Create your spring boot project with [**Spring Initializr**](https://start.spring.io/)

Use the following values to create the your project.
- **Project**: Gradle Project
- **Language**: Java 
- **Spring Boot**: 2.6.3
- **Group**: com.geteche
- **Artifact**: students
- **Name**: students
- **Description**: Spring boot application to handle students related logic 
- **Package name**: com.geteche.students
- **Packaging**: Jar 
- **Java**: 11
- **Dependencies**: click **ADD DEPENDENCIES...** and search for 
  - **`web`** and select **Spring Web**
  - **`actuator`** and select **Spring Boot Actuator**

:::note
These values are for this tutorial only. Outside this tutorial, be sure to use other values to create spring boot application. 
:::

when you are done click **`GENERATE`** and download the **`students.zip`** file to your local machine. 

### 2. Configure and starting the project

After downloading the project we need to do some configuration before we start development. 

1. Copy the downloaded **`students.zip`** file from downloads to your preferred development directory **Eg.** `Documents/projects/`
2. Extract/Unzip **`students.zip`** 
3. Open the `students` project in **IntelliJ IDEA** 
:::note
To open `gradle` project in `IntelliJ IDEA`, goto **`File -> Open`**, browse to the project directory and select **`build.gradle`** file then click on **`Open as Project`**. This will open the project as gradle project and will download all the dependencies defined in `build.gradle` file.   
:::
4. Now that the project is opened in IDEA, Open **`StudentsApplication.java`** that is located in **`src/main/java/com.geteche.students`**
5. Right click inside the code editor and select **`Run StudentsApplication.main()`**. Once the application up and running you will see output similar to below example 
<img src={require('@site/static/img/springboot/springboot_start_log.png').default} />
6. Open Insomnia, you can create and setup a `project -> collection -> folder`, Here create a new request  by going to your folder and clicking the **`+`** button, then make sure to use the following info and hit **`send`** button
      - **name**: API Health Status 
      - **method**: GET 
      - **URL**: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
7. you should get a response in **`JSON`** format like shown below 
```json
{
	"status": "UP"
}
```
### 3. Pushing code to github
